# CTD Assignment 
Ruben Robles


This code shows the data collected from CTD machines dropped by OOI. Our goal for this project was to show
the relationship between depth and the speed of sound profile.

We compared the changes in the two measurments in shallow,deep,summer, and winter and noticed if there were 
differences between the four. 

Included with the programming are graphs that show the dives and the comparision of SSP profiles. 

a.In the charts, we could tell that there were more dives in the summer time as the depth change would tell us when the 
CTD machines would go up and down.

b. The max SSP is usually in the lowest depth from the lowest depth. It was not always the case as sometimes in the winter time the 
highest ssp was in mid depth. 

c. In the night time the ssp profile was
