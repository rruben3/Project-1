# CTD Assignment 
Ruben Robles

For this project we downloaded csv. Data from https://oceanobservatories.org/. They specialize in collecting ocean data and use CTD instruments to collect data in the ocean. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth. The machine has bottles attached to it and collect water as they move in the water. 

This code shows the data collected from CTD machines dropped by OOI. Our goal for this project was to show
the relationship between depth and the speed of sound profile.

We compared the changes in the two measurements in shallow, deep, summer, and winter and noticed if there were 
differences between the four. 

Included with the programming are graphs that show the dives and the comparison of SSP profiles. 

a.In the charts, we could tell that there were more dives in the summer time as the depth change would tell us when the 
CTD machines would go up and down.

b. The max SSP is usually in the lowest depth from the lowest depth. It was not always the case as sometimes in the wintertime the highest ssp was in mid depth. 

c. In the nighttime the ssp profile was faster. I assume it is like that as there is less movement in the water and the water is  more calm

d. In the summer time the ssp was faster as well.

e. It seems that the ssp in the winter was usually more stable as well as faster than in the summer.
