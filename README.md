# CTD Assignment 
Ruben Robles

For this project we downloaded csv. Data from https://oceanobservatories.org/. They specialize in collecting ocean data and use CTD instruments to collect data in the ocean. CTD stands for conductivity, temperature, and depth. The machine has bottles attached to it and collect water as they move in the water. 

This code shows the data collected from CTD machines dropped by OOI. Our goal for this project was to show
the relationship between depth and the speed of sound profile.

We compared the changes in the two measurements in shallow, deep, summer, and winter and noticed if there were 
differences between the four. 

Included with the programming are graphs that show the dives and the comparison of SSP profiles. 

a.In the charts, we could tell that there were more dives in the deep profilers. You can tell the number of dives by the number 
of times the depth returned to the intitial depth. 

b. The max SSP is usually in the shallower depth in the ocean. It was not always the case as sometimes in the wintertime the highest ssp was in mid depth.

c.In the nighttime the ssp profile was faster. I assume it is like that as there is less movement in the water and the water is  more calm

d. When comparing the graphs I could tell that the ssp profile in the summer usually had more dives. As well as had a smoother curve and faster overall ssp than in the winter. 

e. The deeper profiles in the summer were more stable and consistent than in the winter time. It was harder to find data in the winter as there was not as many dives as in the summer.
